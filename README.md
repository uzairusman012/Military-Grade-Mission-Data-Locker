# 🎖️ Military-Grade Mission Data Locker

A Python-based secure information system designed to protect highly sensitive digital files using modern cryptographic methods, simulating defense-grade data protection systems.

## 🔐 **Project Overview**

The **Military-Grade Mission Data Locker** is a complete security framework that demonstrates real-world cryptography implementation. It safeguards mission-critical data through multi-layered protection: military-strength encryption, tamper-proof integrity verification, role-based access control, and comprehensive audit trails.

## ✅ Verification Tests

- [ ] Passwords stored as `$argon2id$` hashes in the `users/` directory  
- [ ] Encrypted files in `storage/` appear as unreadable ciphertext  
- [ ] `logs/audit.log` records all system actions  
- [ ] Pilot role is restricted from encrypting files (Access Denied)  
- [ ] Commander role has full system privileges
